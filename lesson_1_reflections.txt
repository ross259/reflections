How did viewing a diff between two versions of a
file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Because I could narrow my search to only lines that changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history
of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Less time looking for mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro of manual:
- Control over how often commits are made.

Con of manual:
- Must remember to commit.

Pro of auto:
- Frequent commits.

Con of auto:
- No comments on commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google
Docs, treat each file separately?

Git allows multiple files in one commit because many files may
be modified that relate to one change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the
history of files?

# test in middle

View the log, copy the ID's of the files you wish to compare, 
use git diff to compare the copies.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You know you can always revert back to old code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use git to version my code.
